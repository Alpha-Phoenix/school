Stat 241 Lab 2 Prelab:

What is the length of each vector generated?
	20

Boxplots:
	boxplot(x)
		gives a boxplot of x
	boxplot(x~y)
		give 4 side by side boxplots
	What does (~) do in boxplot function?
		It separates variables in te boxplot function; so in boxplot(x ~ y), so foreach x, it is grouped into is corresponding y for boxplot z

Histograms:
	hist(x, col="grey")
		Gives a histogram of x in the color grey
		col determines column color

Scatterplot
	xyplot(z~x)
		Gives a scatter plot with x on the x axis and z on the y
		No relationship existant
	xyplot(z~x | as.factor(x))
		Produces 4 seperate scatterplots
		These scatterplots are subsections of the scatterplot xyplot(z~x) mapped to separated scatterplots corresponding to the y
