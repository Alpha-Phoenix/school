The Stable Matching Problem
---------------------------
	Problem:	Given M men and W women. Each man ranks all women and all women rank all men.
				We want to order th men and women into pairs so that:
					(a) all men and women appears in exactly one pair
					(b) there is no pair of pairs (m,w) and (m1,w1) such that m prefers w1 and w1 prefers m


	Definition:	M = {m1,m2,m3,...mn}
				W = {w1,w2,w3,...wn}

				WxM = {(w,m), w E w, m E M} set of all ordered pairs of men and women from M and W
				A matching J is a sub-set of WxM, ie J <= WxM, such that every man mEM and every women wEW
				appear in at most one pair (same may be unpaired).

				A perfect matching J1 is a sub-set of WxM such that every man mEM and every women wEW appears in exactly one pair

				A pair(W1,m) E WxM is called an instability with respect to a matchign J if
				(w1,m) !E J, but (w,m) and (w1,m1)EJ and m and w1 prefers the other partners to their assigned parties in J

					ie: m ranks w1 higher than w1 ranks m higher than m1

				A matching J is stable if:
					(a) perfect
					(b) there is no instability/unhappiness


	Goal:	Given sets W and M, find a stable matching



Defining Features of an Algorithm:
-----------------------------------
	- is a finite list of instructions
	- each instruction can be descibed precisley
	- starting from an initial state and initial input, the instructions describe a computation of a finite number of successive states, events, eventually producing and output
	- Each state only depends on the input and results of previous states
	- Final state is reached after a finite number of steps (no infinite steps)
